# Automatic Invoicing
This program takes a spreadsheet with a company's clients rate per hour, hourly minimums, supervisor rates and automatically creates multiple invoices with line items for each invoice.

The clients rate spreadsheet is located in the clients rate folder. 
When  you download this repo you can update the client names, hourly rates, hourly minimums and supervisor rates in the client rates spreadsheet. 

The timesheet report can also be updated. You can update the employee names, the dates, location, start time, and end time. Everything needs to be in the same format as seen in this example timesheet. Sometimes you can pull a timesheet report in excel from the timesheet software you already have.

After you run the py file the line item invoices will be in the output folder.
